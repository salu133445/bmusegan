# Abstract

It has been shown recently that convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) are able to capture the temporal-pitch patterns in music using the
piano-roll representation, which represents music by binary-valued time-pitch
matrices. However, existing models can only generate real-valued piano-rolls and
require further post-processing (e.g. hard thresholding, Bernoulli sampling) at
test time to obtain the final binary-valued results. In this work, we first
investigate how the real-valued predictions generated by the generator may lead
to difficulties in training the discriminator. To overcome the binarization
issue, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network,
which uses binary stochastic neurons at the output layer. The whole network can
be trained in a two-stage training setting: the generator and the discriminator
are pretrained in the first stage; the refiner network is then trained along
with the discriminator in the second stage to refine the real-valued piano-rolls
generated by the pretrained generator to binary-valued ones. The proposed model
is able to directly generate binary-valued piano-rolls at test time.
Experimental results show improvements to the existing models in most of the
evaluation metrics.
